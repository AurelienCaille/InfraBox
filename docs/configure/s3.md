# S3
InfraBox requires some object store to persist data. You may use any S3 compatible storage. If you already have a S3 compatible object store you can use it. If not see "use Minio" how you can setup one.

## Configure S3
For install.py use the following options

    --storage s3
    --s3-secret-key <SECRET_KEY>
    --s3-access-key <ACCESS_KEY>
    --s3-region <REGION>
    --s3-endpoint <ENDPOINT>
    --s3-port <PORT>
    --s3-secure <true/false>

## Use Minio
Minio is a S3 compatible storage which you can run yourself in your cluster.
The following instructions are not meant for a production ready setup. You may use it to get started with InfraBox. See the minio documentation on how to setup a production ready cluster.

    ./deploy/install_minio.sh
