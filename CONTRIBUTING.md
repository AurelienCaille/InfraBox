# Contributing to OpenUI5

You want to contribute to InfraBox? Welcome! Please read this document to understand what you can do:
 * [Help Others](#help-others)
 * [Analyze Issues](#analyze-issues)
 * [Report an Issue](#report-an-issue)
 * [Contribute Code](#contribute-code)

## Help Others

You can help InfraBox by helping others who use InfraBox and need support. You will find them e.g. on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/infrabox) or in the [slack channel](https://infrabox.slack.com/)

## Analyze Issues

Analyzing issue reports can be a lot of effort. Any help is welcome!
Go to [the Github issue tracker](https://github.com/SAP/infrabox/issues?state=open) and find an open issue which needs additional work or a bugfix.


## Report an Issue

If you find a bug you are welcome to report it.
We can only handle well-reported, actual bugs, so please follow the guidelines below and use forums like [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/infrabox) for support questions or when in doubt whether the issue is an actual bug.

Once you have familiarized with the guidelines, you can go to the [Github issue tracker for InfraBox](https://github.com/SAP/InfraBox/issues/new) to report the issue.

### Quick Checklist for Bug Reports

Issue report checklist:
 * Real, current bug
 * No duplicate
 * Reproducible
 * Good summary
 * Well-documented
 * Minimal example

### Issue handling process

When an issue is reported, a committer will look at it and either confirm it as a real issue (by giving the "approved" label), close it if it is not an issue, or ask for more details. Approved issues are then either assigned to a committer in GitHub, reported in our internal issue handling system, or left open as "contribution welcome" for easy or not urgent fixes.

An issue that is about a real bug is closed as soon as the fix is committed. The closing comment explains which patch version(s) of UI5 will contain the fix.

### Usage of Labels

Github offers labels to categorize issues. We defined the following labels so far:

Labels for issue categories:
 * bug: this issue is a bug in the code
 * documentation: this issue is about wrong documentation
 * enhancement: this is not a bug report, but an enhancement request

Status of open issues:
 * unconfirmed: this report needs confirmation whether it is really a bug (no label; this is the default status)
 * approved: this issue is confirmed to be a bug
 * author action: the author is required to provide information
 * contribution welcome: this fix/enhancement is approved and you are invited to contribute it

Status/resolution of closed issues:
 * fixed: a fix for the issue was provided
 * duplicate: the issue is also reported in a different ticket and is handled there
 * invalid: for some reason or another this issue report will not be handled further (maybe lack of information or issue does not apply anymore)
 * works: not reproducible or working as expected
 * wontfix: while acknowledged to be an issue, a fix cannot or will not be provided

The labels can only be set and modified by committers.

### Issue Reporting Disclaimer

We want to improve the quality of InfraBox and good bug reports are welcome! But our capacity is limited, so we cannot handle questions or consultation requests and we cannot afford to ask for required details. So we reserve the right to close or to not process insufficient bug reports in favor of those which are very cleanly documented and easy to reproduce. Even though we would like to solve each well-documented issue, there is always the chance that it won't happen - remember: InfraBox is Open Source and comes without warranty.

Bug report analysis support is very welcome! (e.g. pre-analysis or proposing solutions)


## Contribute Code

You are welcome to contribute code to InfraBox in order to fix bugs or to implement new features.

There are three important things to know:

1.  You must be aware of the Apache License (which describes contributions) and **agree to the Contributors License Agreement**. This is common practice in all major Open Source projects. To make this process as simple as possible, we are using *[CLA assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/)* for individual contributions. CLA assistant is an open source tool that integrates with GitHub very well and enables a one-click-experience for accepting the CLA. For company contributers special rules apply. See the respective section below for details.
2.  There are **several requirements regarding code style, quality, and product standards** which need to be met (we also have to follow them). The respective section below gives more details on the coding guidelines.
3.  **Not all proposed contributions can be accepted**. Some features may e.g. just fit a third-party add-on better. The code must fit the overall direction of InfraBox and really improve it, so there should be some "bang for the byte". For most bug fixes this is a given, but major feature implementation first need to be discussed with one of the InfraBox committers, possibly one who touched the related code recently. The more effort you invest, the better you should clarify in advance whether the contribution fits: the best way would be to just open an enhancement ticket in the issue tracker to discuss the feature you plan to implement (make it clear you intend to contribute). We will then forward the proposal to the respective code owner, this avoids disappointment.

### Contributor License Agreement

When you contribute (code, documentation, or anything else), you have to be aware that your contribution is covered by the same [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) that is applied to InfraBox itself.
In particular you need to agree to the Individual Contributor License Agreement,
which can be [found here](https://gist.github.com/CLAassistant/bd1ea8ec8aa0357414e8).
(This applies to all contributors, including those contributing on behalf of a company). If you agree to its content, you simply have to click on the link posted by the CLA assistant as a comment to the pull request. Click it to check the CLA, then accept it on the following screen if you agree to it. CLA assistant will save this decision for upcoming contributions and will notify you if there is any change to the CLA in the meantime.
